		<p>You see a desolated battlefield.</p>
		<p>The land was charred black and blasted full of craters.</p>
		<p>A raging fire danced among the wreckage of a city.</p>
		<p>The wonderful blue sky was tainted with thick black smoke.</p>
		<p>Limbs of bodies lay limp, cold, and bloody on the earth.</p>
		<p>You remember the thought that crossed your mind then. "Ah, this must be what hell is like."</p>
