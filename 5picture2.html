		<p>You see a desolated battlefield where the land was charred black and blasted full of craters.</p>
		<p>In the city that the bridge led to, fire danced among the wreckage.</p>
		<p>Thick smoke filled the air and blocked out the sun and the sky completely.</p>
		<p>Bodies of civilians and soldiers alike lay limp, cold, and bloody.</p>
		<p>You remember the thought that crossed your mind then. "This must be what hell is like."</p>
