	 <p>In the modern ages, not many people visit artworks personally and because of that, 
	 many people have a distorted sense of artworks like the Mona Lisa in which they believe 
	 it is grander than it actually is in real life. Popularity of old artworks overwhelm the 
	 new, and in addition to that, people feel that the conceptual themes newer artworks 
	 frequently take on is controversial. People grew up being taught that famous pieces like 
	 the David and Mona Lisa are art, so this new round of artwork deviating from easy 
	 comprehension and material you can touch, begs the question of what constitutes as “art”?”</p>
