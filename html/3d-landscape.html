     <h1>Project 2: 3D Landscape</h1>

	 <div class="boxed">
	 <p>In this 3D modelling project I decided to work with a partner, and we
	 decided to create a pair of graves because at the time it was almost
	 Halloween.</p>
	 <p>Here is the grave I created using free programs and open source files.</p>
	 <p>This model follows Manovichâ€™s principles because it utilizes all New Media principles described.
	Transcoding is when I converted my .stl file into the 3D printing machine. It went from letters and
	numbers and became something tangible. Here, the principle of numerical representation is
	found in the fact that a file is made up of code. The principle of variability is shown by the fact
	that I used different content I found online (and made sure usage and editing was allowed). This
	also displays the principle of modularity because I used different things to create one object.
	The principle of automation is the fact that I created objects in Blender, but they were
	pre-programmed tools for me to use, so I did not create the objects from scratch.</p>
