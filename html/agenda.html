     <!--STATEMENT-->
     <p>This video is a statement against the idea of the
     gay agenda which was born from negative beliefs
     from the LGBT community. It is supposed  to be an unkind
     expression towards gay people but many of us have
     turned it into a joke, to make fun of those who
     believe that the spread of homosexuality is a bad
     thing. The reason why this is turned into a joke
     is because it seems to be the way of coping these
     days. In an age of memes combined with the same
     homophobic culture that sent kids out their homes or
     to their deaths so long ago, we cope with jokes. </p>
